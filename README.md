# TextManipulator
Provides various tools to help transform data quicker and easier

1. Add Text to Tabbed Data - This allows for text to be put inbetween tabbed data based on a separator key. Great for when you want to create SQL scripts from excel data.

2. Global Scripts - For when you have a script that you wish to run for multiple databases and are too lazy to copy and paste it, and too foolish to invest in a tool that does it for you!

3. Add Commas/Apostrophes - Handy when taking excel data and converting it into strings for SQL to process properly as VARCHAR's. Also can simply trim white space, and add commas to lists.

4. Remove Empty Lines - Ever have some noob write all their code double spaces? It's annoying and looks terrible. This one's for you!

5. --- We won't talk about this one. For legal reasons.

6. Sort a List - Sorts a list alphabetically, numerically, or both!

7. Create Incremental List - Create a list of numbers based on three parameters: start number, increment by, and iterations
